.Contents
Due to the social content of the application and other solid apps that we've seen we decided that
the best option is to do it in a web enviroment and run it on a server so it's more user-friendly.
At the moment the plan for our application structure is based on a JavaScript and TpeScript application with HTML components that follow solid's style guide and pattern in the app apearence.

For the teamwork, project development and documentation we'll be using a GitHub repository to keep thigs in order.


.Motivation
Create a functional solid chat application that is strong and consolidated and can stand a chance in Tim Berners-Lee's contest.


.Form
For the moment we have only a few decisions taken so our reasons are short:

    - Angular, for the base compatibility it has with solid and the auto-generated web framewok.
    - GitHub, by subject requierements.
    - Solid, also by subject requirements.
    - AssciDoctor, subject requirements one more time.
