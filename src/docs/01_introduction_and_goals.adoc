|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Teaching Staff | Teachers | Teacher and in charge of the subject, seeks development within a project and constant work.
| Inrupt | SOLID Team | They establish certain bases to be met in the development and operation of the application, also act as a help factor. 
| Users | Potential users | Those possible users who use the application for the technologies used and their comfort.
| Team | Developtment team | Develop a application that will work and archive at least the minimum requirements planned.
| Developers | External developers | We are deploying an open code product so it might be relevant to bring them some help by coding a clean application
