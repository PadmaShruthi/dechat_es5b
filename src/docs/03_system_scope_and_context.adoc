== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
DeChat must allow communication between two users through text messages. In addition, it will be possible to create groups of users to which all participants can send and receive messages. Also, it must allow sending files, such as images or videos, to the recipient.
A notification will be shown when user receives a message.

.Motivation
Security and privacy is DeChat priority. Messages will never leave user own Solid POD. Instead, recipient system will be asked to retrieve message from senders POD, and will never save messages to recipient POD.
DeChat will only store where message is placed, so app knows where are messages stored when user starts application.

.Form
Lists of communication partners and their interfaces:

* Common interfaces
** Main: List of active chats.
** Chat: List of messages within send or received to/from selected user or group.
** Chat options: Interface enabling user to delete or edit chat configurations.

.Contents
There will be only one communication partner (one role): User. User will be able to send and receive messages.
In the background, RDF will be used to share chat details.

.Motivation
Data will be kept within sender's POD and will never be stored outside it.

.Contents
Since DeChat is under SOLID architecture, we will be using WebID to communicate between users and add friends. SOLID also makes use of RDF, WebSockets, etc.. More info available in https://github.com/solid/solid-spec

.Motivation
Motivation: Respect SOLID architecture.

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
