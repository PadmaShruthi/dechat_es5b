== Introduction and Goals
Our project is part of a university proposal with a basis in cooperation with the company Inrupt and the use of its SOLID design.

In it we will provide a response to the request for a decentralized chat using SOLID. It will consist of the principle of separating the information from the application giving the user the power to control all their data.

In this documentation we will explain all the relevant concepts of our decentralized chat, based on SOLID, following the Arc42 template.

=== Requirements Overview
It is a chat so its most basic requirements are to send and receive messages. But there are other requirements that we are going to explain:

==== Chat Requirements

|====================
|Requirement | Description
|Secure | Connection protocols and personal information security
|Descentraliced | The user is the real data's owner
|Fast and Agile | Real time message system
|Intuitive and Comfy |Easy to learn and use, familiar to the user
|====================

==== Implementation Requirements.

|====================
|Requirement | Description
|Testability | Error and bugs tracking, the architecture should allow easy testing
|Pattern design | Facility to extend, update and fix
|Fast and Agile | Easiest to understand and work with it
|====================

=== Quality Goals

|Quality|Motivation
| Decentralized | Top priority and objective for the chat, is required to work...
| Usable | Chats are one of most common and famous application, is expected to be familiar and intuitive to the user
| Clean code and design | Most of our Stakeholders are developers so, it is relevant to maintain a clean product during its implementation

=== Stakeholders

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Teaching Staff | Teachers | Teacher and in charge of the subject, seeks development within a project and constant work.
| Inrupt | SOLID Team | They establish certain bases to be met in the development and operation of the application, also act as a help factor. 
| Users | Potential users | Those possible users who use the application for the technologies used and their comfort.
| Team | Developtment team | Develop a application that will work and achieve at least the minimum requirements planned.
| Developers | External developers | We are deploying an open code product so it might be relevant to bring them some help by coding a clean application
