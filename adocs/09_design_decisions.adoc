== Design Decisions
In this document we'll show important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions that may greatly influence our project.


.Decisions list:

* Our team has decided to write the code of this program in https://www.javascript.com/[Javascript] using https://nodejs.org/es/[Node.js] as the execution platform for the sake of reducing the dependence on frameworks.

* We toke an initial idea from the Solid-chess that has been previously presented to us since it's a great example of our goal.

* We chose to use the https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client[solid file client library]and https://webpack.js.org/[WebPack] package for the managing of files and folders of this chat as we are based on Solid.

* As we are using https://www.javascript.com/[Javascript] we will use https://mochajs.org/[Mocha] and https://www.chaijs.com/[Chai] for the unit tests because it's convenient.

* We are using https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber] for acceptance tests as recommended by our professor.

* We are using https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] to design the project because some of our members knew how to use it.
