== Design Decisions
In this document we'll show important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.

**TODO**

.Decisions list:
* Our team has decided to use the Angular program recommended by the Solid website to create this chat.

* In addition we are going to base ourselves on the Solid-chess that has been previously presented to us.

* We chose to use the https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client[solid file client library] and https://webpack.js.org/[WebPack] package for the managing of files and folders of this chat as we are based on Solid.
