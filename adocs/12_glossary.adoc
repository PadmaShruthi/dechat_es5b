In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location.

| Framework | A framework is a scheme (a skeleton, a pattern) for the development and/or implementation of an application.

| Git   | Git is a version control software designed by Linus Torvalds, thinking about the efficiency and reliability of maintaining versions of applications when they have a large number of source code files.

| GitHub    | GitHub is a platform for hosting projects using the Git version control system.

| Glossary  | The glossary contains the most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

| Interface | An interface provides a functional connection between two systems, programs or devices and allows communication at different levels allowing the exchange of information.

| Log in    | Log in is the process by which individual access to a   computer system is controlled.

| Open source   | Open source is a model of software development based on open collaboration. It focuses more on the practical benefits (access to source code) than on the ethical or freedom issues that are so prominent in free software.

| SOLID Community | The mission of the Solid Community Group is to try to reshape the web by fostering a new breed of applications with capabilities above and beyond anything that exists today. Participants in this group will create applications, author technical specifications, and capture best practices.

| Template  | A template or interface device usually provides a separation between the form or structure and the content. It is a medium or device or system, that allows to guide, to carry, or to construct, a predefined design or scheme.

| TypeScript | TypeScript is an open source programming language with object-oriented programming tools, very favorable if you have large projects.
