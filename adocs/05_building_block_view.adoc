== Building Block View
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks as well as their dependencies.

=== Whitebox Overall System

We have two views, the main one (index.html), which is the one used to perform the user's logging, and the secondary one (two-people-chat.html) which purpose is to make possible the chat between two people.

It is necessary to incorporate the login module since the application is customized according to the logged user. For example, the friends list will not be the same for all users, but each user will have their own friends list.

Contained building blocks::
    - Login: 
    The user can use this module to log into the application. This module is prior to the chat screen.
    - Chat:
    This module will be divided later. It provides the basic chat functionality.

==== LogIn using data about friends stored on the POD:

The purpose of this box is that the user is able to log in with his own user account that allows him to obtain an experience of the application as personalized as possible.

Solid Community is used to be able to log in using their POD server. The user interface is like any other login screen in a web application.

==== Chat room:

The purpose of this box is to ensure that two users can communicate by chatting.

The user interface will show a side navigation bar showing the friends of the authenticated user with whom he can chat.

The interface also shows, once the friend with whom to chat is selected, a panel in which the conversation is shown in real time.

Below is a sketch of the interface of our chat room.
